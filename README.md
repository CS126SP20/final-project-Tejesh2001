# Final Project

# [CS126 Final Project - Firebending trials]

Author: [Tejesh Bhaumik]

**Desciption**

Based loosely on the TV show Avatar : The Last Airbender. 
You play as Avatar Aang, and you have to fight firebenders who shoot fireballs from the top of the screen. 
You can shoot airballs to deflect these fireballs, or you may dodge them
If you deflect these fireballs though, they might ricochet off the walls and hit you and kill you
You can fire a maximum of five airballs at a time, and each fireball you hit scores you a point
The aim of the game is to last the longest and score the highest points
